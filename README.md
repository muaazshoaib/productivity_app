## App Features

Here's a refined suggestion for placing features in the drawer and the bottom navigation bar based on accessibility, frequency of use, and user expectations:

**Bottom Navigation Bar:**

1. **Home Screen:**
   - Display an overview of tasks for the day.
   - Quick access to main features.

2. **Task Manager:**
   - Create to-do lists, set reminders, and track progress.
   - Given its frequent use, place it in the bottom navigation bar.

3. **Calendar:**
   - Schedule appointments, set reminders, and view upcoming events.
   - As calendar access is a common task, it fits well in the bottom navigation.

4. **ChatBot Integration:**
   - Include it in the bottom navigation for easy and direct access.
   - Users may use ChatGPT for quick task creation, reminders, and notes.

**Drawer Navigation:**

1. **Focus Mode:**
   - Place it in the drawer as it's a feature users may use intentionally but less frequently.

2. **Integration with Productivity Tools:**
   - Include this in the drawer to manage settings related to integrations, including ChatGPT.
   - Users may configure and manage third-party tool integrations here.

3. **Note-taking:**
   - Accessible from the drawer, allowing users to quickly jot down notes or ideas.
   - A dedicated section for organizing and accessing notes.

4. **Pomodoro Timer:**
   - Consider placing it in the drawer as it's a focused work feature, not used continuously throughout the day.

5. **Habit Tracker:**
   - Also, place the habit tracker in the drawer as users may check progress periodically.

6. **Analytics:**
   - Keep analytics in the drawer for periodic review and analysis.
   - Users may not access analytics as frequently as other features.

7. **Settings:**
   - Include a section for general app settings, theme customization, and account settings.
   - Users usually access settings less frequently, making it suitable for the drawer.
